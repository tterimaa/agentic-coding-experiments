# Maximizing productivity should not be your main concern if you're developing AI agents

As AI agents get more capable, we face a growing concern: how do we maintain our skills and fully own the work being done in our name?

Claude Code has a feature called output-styles (type `/output-style`) with a mode called "Learning". Instead of just solving problems for you, it gives you insights into what's happening and lets you implement the critical parts yourself. It generates a skeleton of the implementation with hints to complete it on your own.

Trying this feature I realized something: the future challenge isn't maximizing AI productivity. It's keeping humans engaged with minimal friction.

We need to stay accountable for our work also in the future.

'Learning mode' is one of the many examples of how claude code is currently paving the way in agentic systems. I'm expecting to see this kind of features emerge in other agentic systems in the near future.
